Achievo crontab scripts
=======================

Achievo contains some scripts that you can run from cron to perform
certain actions or checks.

To be able to use these scripts, you need to have the php cgi-binary on your
system.


General instructions
--------------------
If you want to use one of the scripts, edit your crontab (crontab -e on 
most Unix systems), and add a line in the form of:

0 9 * * tue   /usr/bin/php /var/www/achievo/runcron todo.reminder > /dev/null

This will run the reminder.cron script from the todo module every tuesday 
morning at 9 o'clock.

(assuming your php binary is in /usr/bin and Achievo is installed in 
/var/www/html/, if this is not the case, change the values accordingly.)


Available scripts
-----------------
Currently, the following scripts can be used from cron:

* timereg.reminder

   This script checks if all users have registered enough hours in the 
   previous week. 
   It compares the number of hours in the contract of that user with the 
   number of hours actually booked. If the number of booked hours is not 
   enough, an email reminder is sent to that user.

   Note: This script always counts the hours in the previous week from 
   monday to sunday, regardless of the day on which you run the script. This 
   means you can run the script multiple times a week, so people will be 
   reminded more than once if they keep forgetting to register their hours.
   
   Suggested run frequency: once or twice a week.
   Suggested run time: monday morning (and the second one on wednesday 
                       morning)
                      
* todo.reminder
 
   This script sends reminders to people if they have one or more todo's
   open, that are due today, or that are overdue. A cc is sent to the owner
   of the todo.
   If a user has more than one todo assigned, the todos are grouped in a 
   single mail per owner, to prevent users from being spammed with lots
   of todo reminders.
  
   Suggested run frequency: daily
   Suggested run time: in the morning, just before office opening time.
  
   
Add-on modules
--------------

Add-on modules may have their own useful cron scripts. These are usually
located in the cron subdirectory of the module. They can be run using
runcron, like above. 

Example: suppose you have a module 'mymodule' with a file 'dailycheck.cron'
in its cron/ subdirectory. You can run this script by adding this to your 
crontab:

0 9 * * *   /usr/bin/php /var/www/achievo/runcron mymodule.dailycheck

Note that the '.cron' extension of the filename does not need to be passed
to the runcron script.

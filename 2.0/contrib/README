Achievo contributed scripts
===========================

This directory contains scripts that are contributed by users of Achievo. 
These are generally UNTESTED, and NOT SUPPORTED by the Achievo Open Source 
project, but they are included in the release as they might be useful. 

For usage information regarding any of the contributions, please see the 
script header. If you have any questions, please mail the author of the 
contribution directly. Usually the authors are present on the Achievo
forums at http://www.achievo.org/forum, so you might also try to find help 
there.

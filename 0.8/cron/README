Achievo crontab scripts
=======================

This directory contains some scripts that you can run from cron to perform
certain actions or checks.

To be able to use these scripts, you need to have the php cgi-binary on your
system.

General instructions
--------------------

If you want to use one of the scripts, edit your crontab (crontab -e on 
most Unix systems), and add a line in the form of:

0 9 * * tue   /usr/bin/php /var/www/achievo/cron/timereg_check.php > /dev/null

This will run the timereg_check script every tuesday morning at 9 o'clock.

(assuming your php binary is in /usr/bin and Achievo is installed in 
/var/www/html/, if this is not the case, change the values accordingly.)

Available scripts
-----------------
Currently, the following scripts can be used from cron:

* timereg_check.php 

  This script checks if all users have registered enough hours in the 
  previous week. 
  It compares the number of hours in the contract of that user with the 
  number of hours actually booked. If the number of booked hours is not 
  enough, an email reminder is sent to that user.

  Note: This script always counts the hours in the previous week from 
  monday to sunday, regardless of the day on which you run the script. This 
  means you can run the script multiple times a week, so people will be 
  reminded more than once if they still don't register their hours.

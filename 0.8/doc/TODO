TODO List
=========

Functionality
-------------

We have lots of plans with achievo. Eventually, we should be able to use
Achievo to plan all our enterprise resources.

An impression of the ideas we currently have:
- More extensive billing functionality (incl managing debtors and creditors)
- (Incoming/outgoing) order administration
- Stock management
- Project based document management system

We'll add some productivity features too, like a personal agenda or
addressbook.

Basically the possibilities are limitless. We would gladly receive any
suggestions you might have. Please mail your ideas to ivo@achievo.org!
